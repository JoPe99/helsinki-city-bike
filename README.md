# Helsinki City Bike App

# Description of the project: 
The purpose of this project is to showcase data from Helsinki city bikes.


# Prerequisites: 
Should the reviewer install something on their computer before they can compile and run the project? Does the project only work on Windows or Linux? List all steps that need to be done before trying to run the project. If versions are important, remember to mention those as well.

# Configurations: 
Do you have to configure for example database connections locally? Provide clear instructions on what needs to be changed and where. In case you have an .env file which you, of course, should not add to GitHub, you can send that file to the reviewers by other means. How to run the project? Do you have to install some packages or compile the code? If you have separate services for example for backend and frontend, remember to write instructions for all needed services.

## Backend


# Tests 
If your project has tests, include instructions on how to run them.


# Technology choices: 

## Frontend
Frontend is created with Typescript/VueJS accompanied by Vuetify component library. I chose Vue as I have prior experience with it, and it has been a blast to use. Electron is used for packaging the app, making it possible to distribute the frontend app as a single .exe-file.

## Backend
Backend is Kotlin with Spring Boot, along with PostGreSQL. I chose Kotlin as I had some experience with Android Development with it before, and wanted to get backend experience on Kotlin. PostGreSQL is something I have used before and felt it would work fine here too.

## Testing
Frontend unit testing is done with Mocha/Chai, E2E-testing with Cypress, and coverage is provided by Coveralls.
